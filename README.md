# FERN Full-JS web application template

## Installation

Run `npm i` to install all of the required node dependencies. This includes both back-end and front-end dependencies.

# Running project

To run the project `npm run dev`.

## Debug mode

In VSCode we can debug mode by selecting the **Local development** configuration in the debug screen, or simply pressing `F5`. For back-end breakpoints (router or model), regular VSCode breakpoints will suffice to stop the execution. For front-end breakpoints the Chrome Developer tools will display the file structure and breakpoints can be added without further problems.
